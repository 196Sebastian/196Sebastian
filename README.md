Hello World, I'm [Sebastian Correa!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-correa-b6858b177/)

A bit about myself, Iâ€™m a software engineer originally from Chicago now based in NYC! 
As of now, I am focused on Android Development and Kotlin but still wish to explore many fields. 
What I love about programming is that you can consistently create logic that interacts with the 
other parts of the computer and/or other applications with no limitations besides your own ability.
